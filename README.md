# Sunlight::Congress

This is a wrapper for the [Sunlight Foundation's Congress API](http://sunlightlabs.github.io/congress/).

It is very much a work in progress, and only supports part of the API. Any
assistance with implementing extra calls would be appreciated!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'sunlight-congress'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sunlight-congress

## Usage

The first thing you need to do is set up an API key. You can apply for one
[here](http://services.sunlightlabs.com/accounts/register/). They're free and
have no usage limits.

Once you have your key:

```ruby
require 'sunlight-congress'

Sunlight::Congress.api_key = "lolthisisnotarealkey"
```

Then, you can build various objects relating to the API. For example:

```ruby
Sunlight::Congress::Legislator.by_zipcode("90210")
=> [#<Sunlight::Congress::Legislator:0x007fad4a2f67b0 @first_name="Henry"...
```
